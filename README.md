# 4-Way Traffic Light Controller

This project implements a **4-way traffic light controller** using Verilog HDL and carries it through the complete ASIC design flow with Cadence tools. The controller handles signal sequencing (Red, Yellow, Green) across four directions, ensuring safe and efficient intersection management.

## Highlights  
- Designed RTL for a 4-way traffic light controller in Verilog [tlc.v)].  
- Verified functionality with a testbench and Cadence Xcelium simulation [tlc_tb.v].  
- Performed synthesis using Cadence Genus with timing optimization.  
- Applied floorplanning, placement, and routing in Innovus for physical design.  
- Conducted timing closure and generated final layout.  
- Exported GDSII file, completing the ASIC design flow.
