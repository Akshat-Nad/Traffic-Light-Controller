# Traffic-Light-Controller
This project develops a 4-way traffic light controller in Verilog HDL and implements it through the complete ASIC flow using Cadence tools. From RTL coding and simulation to synthesis and physical design, the controller manages Red-Yellow-Green sequencing across four directions for safe and efficient traffic control.
